# Loan Management System

## Overview

This project is a Scala-based Loan Management System designed for banks or government institutions. It handles loan applications, tracks repayments, calculates interest, and generates various reports.


## Setup and Usage

### 1. Compile the Scala Programs

Use a Scala compiler (e.g., scalac) to compile the Scala programs.

```sh
scalac src/*.scala
```

### 2. Run the Loan Management System
Execute the main program to start the Loan Management System.

```sh
scala LoanManagementSystem
```

## Features
- User Authentication: Secure access to the system.
- Loan Application Management: Add, update, and delete loan applications.
- Repayment Tracking: Record and track loan repayments.
- Interest Calculation: Calculate and update interest on outstanding loans.
- Reporting: Generate detailed reports on loans, repayments, and overdue loans.

## Data Files
- users.txt: Text file for user credentials.
- loans.txt: Text file for loan records.
- repayments.txt: Text file for repayment records.
- logfile.txt: Text file for logging system usage and errors.


This structure and code should give you a solid foundation for implementing the Loan Management System in Scala. If you have any specific requirements or further enhancements, feel free to ask!
